# Turo Scraper - Product Roadmap

## Initial ideas on how the scraping workflow would work

1. A chrome extension can be used to pull all the available cars from the search page
    - this would post the car IDs to a backend so that we keep track of all available cars in the market
    - we could do a search 2/3 weeks into the future to ensure that as many cars appear in the search (those booked already wouldnt show)
2. A FastAPI backend that can receive data from the various workflows
    - route to ingest car IDs and add them to our watchlist
    - routes to get data about a specific car
3. Scripts that will pull data from turo
    - Other pages, such as car specific pages, expose more detailed data on availability and specs
    - we can use zenrows proxies and scrapers to get those
4. Scripts that will process the data from turo
    - Daily pricing : https://turo.com/api/vehicle/daily_pricing
        - Shows daily pricing. Wether it was a custom price set by owner or suggestion by turo as well as a boolean for car's availability on that day
        - This data can be used to compute occupancy
        - returns data on each of the upcoming 500 days so we need to fugure out a way of processing data in a smart manner
    - Vehicle details: https://turo.com/api/vehicle/detail?
        - exposes details on car's specs and location


## Parsing and loading data from search results

The chrome extension loads all requests that called "https://turo.com/api/v2/search". The returned object contains a key
"vehicles" that has an array of objects, each containing interesting fields about available vehicles such as avgDailyPrice/completedTrips/hostId/id/make/model/type/year/location.city/location.homeLocation.lat/location.homelocation.lng
